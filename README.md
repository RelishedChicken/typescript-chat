## Typescript Chat Client

This is a simple chat app I've made to help myself learn Typescript, React (via Vite) with Socket.io for messaging.

You can clone the repo and run `npm run dev` to start the dev environment. Please note that the app will also need a server hosted to work too; I've programmed this server and it is available at my repo `typescript-chat-server`.

This is purely for learning purposes and doesn't serve any real use case (apart from maybe sending messages to your own machine!).
